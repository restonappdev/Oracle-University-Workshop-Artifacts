According to the College Board, which developed the AP Program, AP ""enables students to pursue college-level studies while still in high school."" Every May high school students can choose to take one or more standardized AP exams, which are graded by the College Board. AP test results are then reported on a scale of 1 to 5, where: 1 means no recommendation; 2 means possibly qualified; 3 means qualified; 4 means well qualified, and 5 means extremely well qualified."
Advanced Placement,How does Illinois determine AP credit policies?,"Test-based credit policies for the AP program are reviewed by campus faculty on an annual basis. Every fall the coordinator of new student placement and proficiency testing contacts the academic departments to inform them of any changes in AP curricula, exams, and scoring procedures. Faculty then review this material, comparing it to their courses' content, the tasks their students engage in, and the level of mastery their students must demonstrate to earn passing grades in these courses. They then recommend credit policies for the next academic year, which are reviewed by the college in which the department is housed. In setting AP credit policies, the goal is always to ensure to the best of our ability that students earning test-based credit for a course are as well-prepared to succeed in higher-level courses as students who actually took that course on our campus."

The law does not affect policies for any other standardized exam."
Advanced Placement,Is it better for me to accept my AP credit or take the actual course?,"Course credit earned from AP exams will be posted to your official academic record. Whether you choose to take the course anyway will very much depend on your academic strengths, weaknesses, and goals. You should consider the requirements of your current program as well as your future plans. For example, students who think they might go on to graduate school need to be aware that many professional (e.g., medical) and graduate schools will not accept test-based credit. Instead, they require evidence that you successfully completed the actual course at a college or university in order to be considered for admission to a graduate program (e.g., ""MCB 150"" on your transcript and not ""Test-Based Credit for MCB 150""). New students at Illinois can discuss this with their academic advisors when registering for first-semester classes."
